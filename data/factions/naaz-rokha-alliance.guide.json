    "Exploration dominance — Distant Suns lets mechs draw 2 exploration cards and pick 1",
    "Fabrication converts relic fragments into relics or command tokens",
    "Strong starting fleet (2 carriers, 1 destroyer, 2 fighters, 1 mech, 3 infantry) — better than 2c4i start",
    "Eidolon mech functions as both a ship during transport and ground force during invasion",

    "Always explore with mechs when possible — Distant Suns gives choice between 2 cards",

    "Hero grants a free relic + 2 strategy card secondaries without tokens — massive swing turn",
    "Commander unlocks with mechs in 3 systems — gives exploration card when capturing planets",
