  "strengths": [
    "Devour — capture opponent non-structure units destroyed in combat",
    "Amalgamation — produce captured unit types without spending resources",
    "Riftmeld — use captured units to bypass tech prerequisites",
    "Dimensional Tears under space docks create gravity rifts only you move freely through",
    "Psychological pressure — opponents fear losing ships to your capture mechanic"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Limited starting expansion — 1 space dock, modest units",
    "Fixed production limit of 5 per dock (not planet value +2)",
    "Success relies on accumulating captured units — poor combat luck is devastating",
    "If opponents blockade a space dock, you must return all captured units from that dock"
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Focus on early combat engagements to start capturing opponent units",
    "Establish multiple Dimensional Tears to unlock Commander (requires units in 3 gravity rifts)",
    "Use Riftmeld to convert captured units into tech prerequisites — enormous efficiency gain",
    "Dimensional Tear II is a key upgrade for production and rift expansion",
    "Protect space docks from blockade — losing captured units is catastrophic",
    "The psychological threat of capture is as valuable as the actual mechanic"
