  "factionId": "xxcha-kingdom",
  "strengths": [
    "Exceptional trade and negotiation tools",
    "Extremely difficult to assault — PDS network + abilities",
    "Quash (cancel an agenda) and Instinct Training are sellable services",
    "Flagship is the primary offensive weapon"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Diplomacy strategy card often unavailable early when you need it most",
    "Duranium Armor disadvantage — opponents sustain through your PDS",
    "Ground force clusters bypass your space defenses",
    "Low mobility without tech investment"
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Execute defensive abilities but maintain scoring focus — don't over-invest in defense",
    "Acquire flagship rapidly but protect it from early loss",
    "Secure a slightly expanded territory slice with PDS network lock-down",
    "Emphasize influence acquisition (command tokens fuel ability usage)",
    "Commercialize abilities: sell Quash and Instinct Training for trade goods/favors",
    "Pursue Cruiser II for mobility or place Space Dock IIs on borders for expansion",
    "Defensive abilities define the faction; offense comes exclusively from flagship"
