  "strengths": [
    "Maximum starting technology (4 techs)",
    "Extreme flexibility — can pivot to any strategy",
    "Round 2 unlimited tech acquisition capability",
    "Effortless tech objectives",
    "Superior starting fleet quality"

  "weaknesses": [
    "Metagame vulnerability — everyone knows you're strong",
    "Early aggression susceptibility (weak military early)",
    "-1 combat modifier (Fragile) on all rolls",
    "Specific threats: Saar, Sardakk, Nekro, Mentak, Yin"
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Acquire one tech per turn while establishing a defensive position and scoring objectives",
    "Build economy through trading (limited early planet control capability)",
    "Sell racial promissory note every turn; be transparent about tech provision expectations",
    "Round 2 War Sun is possible — withhold promissory note until after acquisition if pursuing this",
    "Avoid early victory positioning; maintain friendly stance and execute trades",
    "Infantry/ground combat is your critical weakness — always bring extra ground forces",
    "The -1 combat modifier becomes less significant with larger vessels (dreadnoughts, war suns)"
