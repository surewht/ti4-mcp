  "factionId": "arborec",
  "strengths": [
    "Flexible infantry production via Letani Warriors",
    "Exceptional planet defense once established",
    "Late-game snowballing with rapid unit recovery",
    "Flagship produces 5 infantry on landing, great for recovery after losses"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Slow opening, vulnerable to early aggression",
    "Susceptible to bombardment (Letnev, Muaat, Sardakk, L1Z1X)",
    "Weak against fast-expanding factions early (Creuss, Saar, Sol)"
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Play cautiously early; prepare for Stage II objectives",
    "Start as speaker for survival advantage if possible",
    "Obtain Sarween Tools and a second carrier by round 2",
    "Root into opponent territories strategically — your infantry production makes you hard to dislodge",
    "Use flagship for recovery after losses with its 5 infantry capacity"
