    "Edict ability — winning combat grants command tokens from opponents, scaling with player count",

  "weaknesses": [
    "Hubris forces purging alliance promissory notes — removes diplomatic flexibility",
    "Entire strategy requires winning fights; extended peace makes you weaker",

    "Start conservatively while leveraging Bio-Stims and Predictive Intelligence (starting techs)",
    "Target multiple opponents early with limited conflicts to gather tokens before retaliation",

    "Use Imperia strategically — borrowed commander abilities can swing games",
    "Flagship is most effective against players you haven't beaten yet (no token in your pool)",
    "Win-rate has skyrocketed recently as players learn to leverage the token economy"
